                        Dear Students, Faculty, and Staff,
                        <br><br>
                        With over 16 years of experience, I bring a blend of industrial and academic expertise to help
                        maintain the highest standards of pharmacy education. My goal is to continuously elevate the
                        quality of education at ITM Group of Pharmacy, building a stronger bond between our esteemed
                        academicians and the aspiring pharmacy professionals.
                        <br><br>
                        Being actively involved in professional organizations and research associations, I am deeply
                        committed to promoting research and developmental activities in the field. I am particularly
                        passionate about designing and characterizing controlled release drug delivery systems and
                        complexation technologies, which are at the forefront of pharmaceutical innovations.
                        <br><br>
                        When I'm not immersed in my professional work, I enjoy spending time in nature, camping, and
                        taking care of animals. I also have a keen interest in elemental section studies, which fuels my
                        curiosity for the natural world.
                        <br><br>
                        I encourage all students to leverage the abundant opportunities available at ITM Group of
                        Pharmacy, and together, we will continue to advance in our journey of academic excellence. Letâ€™s
                        all work toward a brighter and successful future in the field of pharmacy education and
                        research.
